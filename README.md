Playing with lang graph

Goals:
* Make a basic lang graph with one agent and a UI or discord bot, so I can interact with a single agent as I would with chatgpt
* Add an agent that monitors messages for things worth remembering and adding them to a knoweldge base
* Add a RAG
* Use what I learned to come up with a more complete solution in another repo.
